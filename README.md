# Alternative Ballistics Core for SOC Mini-Repack

This repository provides the Alternative Ballistics Core addon for the Shadow of Chernobyl (SOC) mini-repack. Inspired by Decane's work on the optional feature for Sky Reclamation Project (SRP), it aims to provide a more balanced and challenging ballistic experience while staying true to the core gameplay of SOC.

**Key Features:**

- Overhauled Ballistics: Weapon ballistics and ammunition properties are reworked for a more realistic feel.
- AI Behavior and Accuracy: Adjusted AI behavior and accuracy complement the new ballistics system.
- Damage System: Modified damage inflicted by weapons on the player and NPCs (mutants addressed in future updates).
- Vanilla Player Attributes: Maintains player attribute adjustments from the mini-repack for a consistent experience.

**Difficulty Options:**

- Original SRP Ballistics (100% Damage): Offers a highly lethal, realistic ballistic experience.
- Reduced Weapon Damage (35%): Provides a more balanced challenge with reduced lethality.

**Important Notes:**

- This addon is recommended for experienced players familiar with the vanilla game.
- The 35% damage reduction is a temporary value, subject to change based on player feedback.
- Mutants might require additional balancing in future updates.

**Learning and Customization:**

This repository serves two purposes:

1. Learning: It allows you to explore the changes made to the game's configuration files to achieve the Alternative Ballistics effects.
2. Customization: You can use the provided files as a reference to tweak the mini repack or the game itself to your preferences.

**Credits and Thanks:**

- My sincere gratitude to Decane and the contributors for creating the remarkable Sky Reclamation Project. It's a truly impressive mod that addresses many vanilla Clear Sky oddities and significantly enhances the gameplay experience. Their work provided a strong foundation for this Alternative Ballistics addon.
- Special thanks to mortany and VaIeroK for developing the OGF tool. This fantastic utility allowed me to effortlessly modify the model files to integrate the new configuration files. Their tool was instrumental in achieving the desired changes within SOC.
